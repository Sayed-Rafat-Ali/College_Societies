        <p><span> <strong>AKGEC-FABLAB</strong><br><br>

            A fab lab is an initiative of Prof. Neil Gershenfeld from MIT, USA which is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything".AKGEC has established Fab Lab in response to the need arising from students requiring a dedicated space and appropriate equipment to develop their projects. Since then it evolved from being just a product development center to a facility focussed on promoting innovation, imparting much-needed skills for innovators and help developing competency across different disciplines including mechanical, electronics and embedded development areas.This is done through providing access to tool, capabilities and knowledgeable trainers and gurus who can help anyone bring their ideas to reality.The center hosts rapid prototyping tools, training kits hardware and software which can be used to train on and fabricate using digital fabrication techniques. It aims to provide training to undergraduates, postgraduates, young kids and to engage with the local community of makers and innovators.These training and experience in digital fabrication techniques not only allows students to apply their theory in practice enhancing their learning of fundamental engineering but is also meant to cater to the need of the hour that is achieving self-sustainability through innovation and entrepreneurship.
